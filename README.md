sample CRUD application using NODEJS with PostgreSQL


This is an extremely simple NODEJS application built on top of Express. It connects to a PostgreSQL server and display some database rows in 
graphical (d3.js) or tabular (Datatable) form .

What do you need?
	a. NODES itself. 
	b. A good editor -- I am using Sublime myself; I highlight this as you might need 'tab conscious' editor to work well with jade.
	c. You can use 'express' for web server.
	d. You can use 'pg-query' for database interface to PostgresSQL.
	e. You can use 'async' for asynchronous database queries.
	f. You can use 'd3' to visualize your data.
	g. You can use 'jQuery' for tabs, tables, form implementation in web pages.
	h. A good debugger 
	   - The simplest one, google chrome. When you load a page in chrome tab, just right click and select 'Inspect element', and here you go.
	   - Another one, Firebug, a google chrome plugin. I installed this one, and it seems powerful, but I haven't used it much yet. No comment.
