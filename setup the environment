What do you need? 

** NODES itself.  
** A good editor -- I am using Sublime myself; I highlight this as you might need 'tab conscious' editor to work well with jade; I don't need to mention other good feature about it. It is already widely recognized among the communitiy.
** You can use 'express' for web server. 
** You can use 'pg-query' for database interface to PostgresSQL. 
** You can use 'async' for asynchronous database queries. 
** You can use 'd3' to visualize your data. 
** You can use 'jQuery' for tabs, tables, form implementation in web pages. 
** A good debugger -- the simplest one, google chrome itself. When you load a page in chrome tab, just right click and select 'Inspect element', and here you go. 
Another one, Firebug, a google chrome plugin. I installed this one, and it seems powerful, but I havenâ€™t used it much yet. No comment.
